Description
JavaScript - OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) word game "Phrase Hunter."  A random phrase is chosen from a set of phrases and the  letters are displayed on the screen. Each letter is represented by a box holding the hidden letter. The user can either use the keyboard to type a letter to guess or can click on a letter displayed on the screen. If a letter is chosen that is not in the phrase, the user will lose a life and one of the hearts below the phrase will be removed. If no more hearts exist, the game is over and a loosing message will be displayed. If the user completes the phrase, a winning message is displayed.
